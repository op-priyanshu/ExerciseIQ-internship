1. Setup ssh keys for git cloning to work seamlessly. DONE

2. Sync to https://github.com/jvgenterprises/ExerciseIQ/commit/8a31b66f9e18ba8adbbb22b36fdc12b787df2e59 and follow https://github.com/jvgenterprises/ExerciseIQ/blob/main/README.md DONE

3. Mini training on git - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTjRZNkhiEU looks promising. ALMOST DONE

4. Review the code of banded T (half a day) DONE

5a. Make cat cow config driven (half a day) DONE, we should raise PR, review and merge. - https://github.com/jvgenterprises/ExerciseIQ/pull/3
5b. record a happy path video and tune.(depends on analysis in 7). DONE - recording in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xzaF-LjpgqzpGEc398zqssTVJwp9qeSQ

6a. Debug Shoulder blade squeeze and attempt the bug fixes. (DONE)
6b. Also record a video with a happy path and a sad path. (depends on analysis in 7) PARTIALLY DONE - recording in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xzaF-LjpgqzpGEc398zqssTVJwp9qeSQ

7. Try out the --save_video flag for the exercises: banded T, banded W and cat cow.
Observation: Sometimes there is an error during startup, also sometimes there is a partial recording as the error happens midway.
Tracking Issues were filed https://github.com/jvgenterprises/ExerciseIQ/issues/1 and https://github.com/jvgenterprises/ExerciseIQ/issues/2
Currently not a blocker to save the videos.

8. We started working on a new set of back exercises - 5 in total.
a. Prone Straight Leg Raise
b. Straight Leg Raise
c. Hip Abduction (side lying)
d. Cobra pose
e. Back isometric (pelvic tilt)

We created a stand alone program (https://github.com/jvgenterprises/ExerciseIQ/blob/jan31/lyingdowndetector.py) to detect the pose of lying down based on input images.
For the above exercises we need variations of lying down in many exercises. It is imperative to come up with a
robust lying down pose detector.

Lets record 1 video of 5 to 10 repeats per back exercise. location = https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xzaF-LjpgqzpGEc398zqssTVJwp9qeSQ

We can create a universal debug tool to take a config of landmarks and angles and display them for any video.
